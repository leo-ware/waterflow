    "\n",
    "I modeled this scenario using a 2-dimensional cellular automata on an nxn grid. An nxn grid called the ground_level tracks the height of the soil at each grid space, which is static over the course of the simulation. The height of the ground at each space $(i, j)$ is referred to as $g_{ij}$. An nxn grid called the water_depth tracks the amount of water in each space. These are both measured in meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main mechanics by which water moves around in the simulation: rainfall, inundation, and runoff. Inundation is when water is absorbed by the soil. Runoff is when water is transported downhill by gravity. The update for each of these steps is calculated in order for each grid space: first rainfall, then inundation, then runoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rainfall is the main stochastic element of this simulation. I choose a simple mechanism to model. Each grid space on the map is assigned a number $r_{ij}$ between $0$ and $1$. At each step, with probability $r_{ij}$, $r_{amount}$ units of water are added to the space. The $r_{amount}$ parameter is constant across the model. This allows for modeling disparate rainfall in different regions of the simulation, but it also keeps it simple and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model inundation, the simulation tracks the total amount of water $i_{ij}$ that has been absorbed by each grid space. This is initialized to zero for all spaces. I chose two parameters — $i_{max}$ and $i_{rate}$ — for the simulation. The $i_{max}$ parameter represents the maximum amount of water that each space can absorb, and $i_{rate}$ represents the speed at which water is absorbed by each space. On each step, each space $(i, j)$ can absorb at maximum $i_{rate}(i_{max} - i_{ij})$ units of water. It will absorb water until either it reaches this threshold or there is no remaining water above ground in the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation models runoff by working from each grid space and trying to use the water available in the space to balance the water levels between it and adjacent cells. At each step, an amount of water (called the excess water) is removed from each grid space $(i, j)$. Then, that water is distributed among the 9-space Moore neighborhood of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the excess water is distributed is analogous to pouring water into nine connected bins with bottoms at different heights. The bin with the lowest bottom will start to fill up first, followed by the second lowest bottom, etc. This diagram illustrates how rainfall can be distributed in this way, although in the simulation there would always be nine bins rather than 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](imgs/balancing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Part or all of the excess water can be distributed back into the grid square $(i, j)$. Once the excess water is removed from this space, its water level is recalculated, and it is treated like any of its neighbors for the purpose of distributing the excess water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of water that is removed from each space $(i, j)$ is determined by how much higher the water level is at that space than the surrounding spaces. The amount is the difference between the water level at $(i, j)$ and the lowest water level among cells in the Moore neighborhood of $(i, j)$.\n"

This is a contour plot of the logged elevation, which I found resulted in the most intuitive visualization. The red dots represent houses (I made up the locations).\n",

I used a multivariate normal pdf to get this shape, but that was pretty arbitrary. I just wanted a shape that looked kind of like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](imgs/rainfall_density.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of other parameters. To parametrize rainfall, there are $r_{amount}$ and $r_{ij}$. I choose r_amount to be a small number ($0.01$). To parametrize inundation, there are $i_{rate}$ and $i_{max}$. For $i_{max}$, I chose the value $0.04$. So, each grid space can absorb up to $4$ centimeters of rain. For $i_{rate}$, I chose $0.2$. I had trouble finding research I could use to back up these values, so they are mostly based on guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to use an absorbing boundary condition for this simulation. At the edge of the grid, the unmodeled ground to the outside is assumed to be level with the height of the grid at the edge. Water runoff of the sides is then treated like water runoff into any other space. Water that leaves the grid in this way is removed from the simulation."

Otherwise, they are generally harmless. So, for this system, I chose to track the amount of time that the flood water submersed key areas of the map. If the floods waters failed to reach these regions, that would be considered especially good. If they are only there briefly, that is a bad but acceptable outcome.\n",

    "Performance was a major concern with this simulation. It is extremely computationally intensive to run for large numbers of timesteps, and I wanted to be able to experiment with multiple interventions at a reasonable speed. So, I used NumPy for the less computationally intensive parts of the simulations, and I used jit-compiled operations on Jax arrays for the expensive parts. I avoided normal Python as much as possible. Although the simulation is still slow, I was able to cut down the compute time significantly by using these libraries and a number of clever tricks to speed up various parts of the computation."

This makes it makes it possible to use column vectors to describe attributes of all the grid spaces.\n",

So, for each row $k$ of the matrix, the $1$ entries denote the grid cells from which $k$ collects water runoff.
